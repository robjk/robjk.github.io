[NYSE Pillar](https://www.nyse.com/equities-insights#20190919)
> Pillar's anticipated benefits are already being realized. In particular, the new "Native Gateway" order entry protocols offer dramatic improvements for members and their clients:
1. Up to a 95% Reduction in Latency: The roundtrip latency on NYSE Pillar order entry sessions via Pillar matching engines has been reduced from ~592μs to ~32μs for FIX and from ~96μs to ~26μs for Binary, getting client orders into the market much faster. With a 92% improvement in the 99th percentile latency results, clients can also have more confidence in improved performance consistency regardless of market conditions.
2. Cost reduction: The amount of messages capable of being processed over an order entry session has increased from 1,000 messages per second to 5,000 messages per second (500 messages per 100 milliseconds, to be specific). This increase enables clients to submit 5 times the amount of orders over one single session.  Session fees have remained unchanged, resulting in cost-reduction opportunities for the industry.
