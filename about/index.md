My name is Rob, I cajole computers into doing things, on occasion they've been known to be useful things

This site collates various links/topics of relevance to me - easily accessible non-proprietary external storage 

Over the years I've tried: del.icio.us, evernote, pocket, onenote and confluence  
I'm guardedly optimistic that, **this time, really**, jekyll/github pages might actually be it
